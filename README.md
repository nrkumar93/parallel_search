# PINSAT: Parallelized Interleaving of Search and Trajectory Optimization

This repository is forked from [Parallel Search Algorithms Library](https://github.com/shohinm/parallel_search). This software equips INSAT [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12548), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08627) with parallel processing capability, namely _PINSAT_, using the ideas developed in [ePA\*SE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01369). 

NOTE: All the previous versions and implementations of INSAT are going through a transition to adapt to this multi-threaded framework. Hence, please check this space back if the recent publications are not added yet. Sorry for the inconvenience.
